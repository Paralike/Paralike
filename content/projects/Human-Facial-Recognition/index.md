## Abstract

In this report, I would like to present the experiences I gained during the task of developing an emotion categorization system based on facial expressions. Throughout the development process, I explored several areas that were previously unfamiliar to me. As a result, I gained a broader understanding of various classification architectures and their peculiarities. I worked with four classification models, achieving varying levels of success. Additionally, I gained insights into determining the accuracy and reliability of each model, enabling us to select the most suitable model for a given task and situation.

## Introduction
In recent times, machine learning has undergone revolutionary advancements, leading to the emergence of increasingly better architectures. But have these advancements truly resulted in improvements? Can a machine surpass human knowledge? In the following pages, I seek to answer these questions in a subject that often challenges even the capacities of the human brain: predicting a person's emotional state based on facial expressions.
