I worked with Adam at Taxually in the Organizational Engineering Team. He is a real teamplayer, we had a lot of projects together, he could always help me in technical questions and having a great idea even for the smallest problems. I liked to work with him because he is very talented and he has very efficient way of thinking. He was never afraid to say the truth and having a constructive opinion about the solutions we built.
I think he will easily solve any problems in the future, and will be a good teammate in any situations.
