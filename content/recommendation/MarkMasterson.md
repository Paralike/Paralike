Adam worked within my overall span of control at Taxually, where he was a high performer. I would hire Adam again, and recommend him without hesitation.

Adam joined my organisation at Taxually as one of the founding members of Organisation Engineering or OrgEng. OrgEng's broad remit was to be the 'body' and 'nervous system' of the company, and was therefore comprised of multiple domains spanning areas such as PeopleOps (HR) to FinOps (accounting and commercial management). 

Adam joined as a founding member of the DigOps (digital operations) team, tasked with customer support and triage. As such, Adam's work went well beyond simply executing those tasks -- he helped design and implement these capabilities from scratch at Taxually. As well as excelling within that scope, he also demonstrated drive, ambition and the ability to take on additional responsibilities and scope. As just one example, his work in applying data science skills to the DigOps domain helped us quickly iterate, and evolve that domain with dramatically positive outcomes.

As a consequence of his performance, we promoted Adam into a Product Engineering role near the end of my tenure. I recommend him with reservation.
